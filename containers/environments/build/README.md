# Build environments

This folder contains code for the construction of build environments for a variety of software projects.
The environments are typically based on the current stable release of Debian, created in the form of Docker images, to be used interactively or non-interactively.

Docker images are generated via GitHub Actions
and deployed to Docker Hub:
