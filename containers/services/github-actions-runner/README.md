## Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner

The files in this folder create a container image
with the latest stable version of Ubuntu and
the official GitHub Actions runner
from https://github.com/actions/runner.

It can be used to build repositories
containing GitHub Actions YAMLs
or to test GitHub Actions YAMLs
e.g. before committing them.
